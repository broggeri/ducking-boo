Step 1
you will have databases such as "apples - 1€" (description, price)
you will get inputs such as "apples"
if you do find it in your database, you have to print the total cents of cumulated products
you have only one word per line
example: "apples" ==> output: 100
then "apples" again, ==> output: 200

if you have bananas - 1.5€ in your database, and as input, you get "bananas" (in addition to the previous commands), then output ==> 350
then if you have "oranges" and it doesn't appear in your database, you have output ==> 350
cause oranges = 0
your database is for now:
- apples - 1€
- bananas - 1.5€
- cherries 0.75€
accept only one word per line

Step 2
every two cherries you save 20 cents


Step 3
if you allow CSV formats each line starts over (example: apples, apples ==> 200
NEW LINE: apples, bananas ==> 250)
