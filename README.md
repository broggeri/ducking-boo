you will have databases such as "apples - 1€" (description, price)
you will get inputs such as "apples"
if you do find it in your database, you have to print the total cents of cumulated products
example: "apples" ==> output: 100
then "apples" again, ==> output: 200
if you have bananas - 1.5€ in your database, and as input, you get "bananas" (in addition to the previous commands), then output ==> 350
then if you have "oranges" and it doesn't appear in your database, you have output ==> 350
cause oranges = 0
your database is for now:
- apples - 1€
- bananaas - 1.5€
- cherries 0.75€
accept only one word per line
(!) every two cherries you save 20 cents
